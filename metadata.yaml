description: A'Beckett and Leech were original contributors to "Punch, or the London
  Charivari" magazine, established 1841. It became the famous "Punch" magazine and
  remained in publication to 2002. A'Beckett also wrote editorials for a similar concept
  magazine, "Figaro in London" that ceased publication in 1839. "In commencing this
  work, the object of the Author was, as he stated in the Prospectus, to blend amusement
  with instruction, by serving up, in as palatable a shape as he could, the facts
  of English History. He pledged himself not to sacrifice the substance to the seasoning;
  and though he has certainly been a little free in the use of his sauce, he hopes
  that he has not produced a mere hash on the present occasion. His object has been
  to furnish something which may be allowed to take its place as a standing at the
  library table, and which, though light, may not be found devoid of nutriment."--Preface.
